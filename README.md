# Fake-Product-Identification-Using-Blockchain

Abstract : The manufacturing as well as marketing of counterfeit or duplicate products and goods leads to consequential financial, health and safety threat to end users. It also has adverse effect on the economic growth of original manufacturers and businesses through revenue loss, product defamation, downtime, replacement expenses, forcing many brands to spend money on fighting counterfeits, trust among business partners can also be at risk, stealing sales etc. To overcome and stop these crucial effects of counterfeiting, a blockchain based system is used in identification of original products and also detects duplicate products to ensure the identification of original goods. This approach to cut down counterfeit as fake ensures that consumers won't completely rely on merchants to determine if products are original or forged.
